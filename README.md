Hello, everyone. I applaud everyone's enthusiasm for coding and problem solving.
As a problem-solving enthusiast, I saw an issue that is quite significant in our daily lives.
Everyone is aware of their income, but most are unaware of their spending.
To manage a monthly budget, we must first understand our income and spending.
To overcome that problem, I created a solution that will assist you in sticking to your budget and providing you with detailed information about your monthly expenses.
The solution is a calculator.
This is not your typical calculator; it is a budget calculator that prompts you to fill out forms as if it were conversing with you.
I built this calculator in C language.
